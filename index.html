<a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About Juliette</h3>

<p>Technologically-inclined female who loves both web-related things and culinary arts. Programming and recipes are my thing! Currently learning about web development.</p>

<h3>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I Do</h3>

<p>Food Service is a passion of mine! I am a homemaker, so of course I manage the household. I solve problems, I cook, I clean. 
  Most people in Food Service aren't very strong with computers, 
  but I am. I also have restaurant experience in dough production and management. 
  I love cooking and cannot go a day without doing it.
</p>

<p>Programming is tricky, yet addictive for me. 
  I have worked with Python and C programming (but also have lightly worked with SQL) and just recently improved my CSS skills.
  JavaScript is the current language I am learning. I really have come to enjoy learning and applying SEO as well. 
  My favorite aspect of programming is how it makes any job easier!

<p>I am subscribed to a few web development newsletters and I use these resources to not only stay up-do-date with current trends, but also, as I learn new things, I blog for <a href="https://webdeveloptogetherblog.wordpress.com/">Let's Web Develop Together</a> with <a href="http://www.moritzzimmer.com/">Moritz Zimmer</a>. I am actively involved with two cooking websites, <a href="http://www.juliettesrecipes.com/">Juliette's Recipes</a> and <a href="http://www.copyandpasta.com/">Copy & Pasta</a>. Both of these websites are a collaboration between myself and <a href="http://www.moritzzimmer.com/">Moritz Zimmer</a>. I had a lot to do with the content creation for these websites. I also have one other web development (WordPress) website that is full of lots of helpful links that relate to web development: <a href="https://webdevcatblog.wordpress.com/">Web Dev Cat's Blog</a>. While it is a simple website, it very much demonstrates what a thorough researcher I am when it comes to learning and being able to make use of what I find.</p>
