<p>Techy girl who also loves both technology and culinary arts. Programming and recipes are my thing! Currently learning about web development.</p>

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What I Do</h3>

<p>Food Service is a passion of mine! I am a homemaker. I solve problems, I cook, I clean. I manage the household. Most people in Food Service aren't very strong with computers, but I am. I also have restaurant management experience in dough production. I love cooking and cannot go a day without doing it.
</p>

<p>Programming is tricky, yet addictive for me. I have worked with Python and C programming (but also have lightly worked with SQL) and just recently improved my CSS skills. JavaScript is the current language I am learning. I really have come to enjoy thinking about SEO as well. My favorite aspect of programming is how it makes any job easier!

<p>I am subscribed to a few web development newsletters, and enjoy occaisonaly blogging for <a href="https://webdeveloptogetherblog.wordpress.com/">Let's Web Develop Together</a> with <a href="http://www.moritzzimmer.com/">Moritz Zimmer</a>. I have two cooking websites, <a href="http://www.juliettesrecipes.com/">Juliette's Recipes</a> and <a href="http://www.copyandpasta.com/">Copy & Pasta</a>. Both of these websites were a collaboration between myself and Moritz Zimmer. I had a lot to do with developing content on these websites. I also have a web development (WordPress) website that is full of lots of helpful links that relate to web development: <a href="https://webdevcatblog.wordpress.com/">Web Dev Cat's Blog</a>. It is a simple website, yet demonstrates what a thorough researcher I am when it comes to teaching myself about Web Development and being able to make use of it.</p>
